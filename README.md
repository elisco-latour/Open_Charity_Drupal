# OpenCharity Drupal 7 theme
### Description:
This is a drupal 7 theme, for a test for compucorp.
All the HTML and css have been created from scratch.

### How i build this theme:
First i figured out that, drupal depends a lot on layout and te design of each component.
 - I choose to build the whole theme, in a static manner with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. [See everything about the static theme ](https://github.com/elisco-latour/Open_Charity_HTML) 
 - Then based on that static version of the theme, i use drupal paradigms to layout the theme.
 - And major components as drupal custom blocks
 
The __layout__ and the grid system of the design is entirely based on flexbox. I choose flexbox because it 
helps me to go align elements easily in their containers, and make the segmentation of columns with precisions.
And i use media queries to implement the __responsivity__
